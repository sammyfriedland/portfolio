          <h5>Video Games: Minecraft</h5>
          <p>My favorite game of all time is Minecraft. I love how you can experience so many different niches and communities within the broader Minecraft community. You can do so many things, such as creating maps, datapacks, texture packs, mods, or you can play those things. You can choose between all of the different versions, whether you want to play the old combat system on 1.8.9, or the new one on the latest version. There are essentially limitless servers for you to explore, from minigame based servers such as Hypixel, to PVP(player vs. player) servers such as PVP Legacy, to a survival world with your friends. Another reason Minecraft is such an enjoyable experience is that the developers encourage modding the game, which has resulted in Minecraft becoming the game with the most mods, allowing for nearly limitless ways to play. You can use simple utility mods, that make previously unavailble information available everywhere, or that change the way the game looks.</p>

          <h5>Dungeons and Dragons</h5>
          <p>Dungeons and Dragons, also known as D&D, is an incredibly open-ended tabletop role-playing game (TRPG). In D&D, the players create the story through their actions, which the Dungeon Master(DM) can adjust the story to. Every time you play, it is a new experience. While D&D seems daunting to beginners, once you start playing, it is really fun. If you don't like the base classes or races, you can use something called homebrew to completely change the game in any way you want. D&D is an open ended experience, where you can do as little or as much as you want.</p>

          <h5>VR</h5>
          <p>Virtual Reality is and always has been a very cool idea. Being fully immersed in another world is an experience like no other. It is also good because it does provide a little bit of excercise. Horror games in VR give a whole new meaning to the "horror" genre. VR has so many options, and a lot of the games I already know and play, such as Minecraft, are not that hard to set up in VR. With how good the technology already is, I can't wait to see where it goes in the future.</p>
